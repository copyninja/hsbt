A bit torrent client in Haskell
==============================

I started writing a bittorrent client in C but it occured to me that these are exactly
the things high level languages are good for and it looks like great opportunity to
learn Haskell and its libraries.

It is vapourware at the moment. Follow along if you want to see me fumble with Haskell.
To me, it is learning. Everyone has to start somewhere.
